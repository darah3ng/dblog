## Why I built

I wanted to see if you can build a blog website without needing to rely on cloud storage services.

I did some googling and came across this [article](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/sourcing-data/sourcing-from-netlify-cms/#processing-netlify-cms-output-with-gatsby), so I decided to build one.
